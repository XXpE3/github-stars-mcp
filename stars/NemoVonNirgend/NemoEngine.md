# NemoEngine
A achieve of my SillyTavern Preset.
- If you're using qvink there seems to be a issue with the way tokens are counted. I'll likely look into this tomorrow once I wake up.

- setup your reasoning/start reply with using the following settings inside Advanced Formatting if you're using the thinking prompt (I.eðŸ§ ï¸±Thought: Council of Avi!)

- If your message is getting cut off half way, try enabling show {{user}} and show {{char}} in chat under user settings apparently this can fix it.

- If you're on the latest sillytavern staging branch with post processing, I found refusals are much more common, I'll look into why tomorrow, personally I rolled back to the branch before they where released. Seems like strict works for most people.

- if you're having issues with setting it up, and just want a out of the box experience I put my personal version up on the github in the nemosets My personal preset. It doesn't have any of the optionla NSFW stuff, but it should work, and you can mess around with it and see what you like just starting small.
