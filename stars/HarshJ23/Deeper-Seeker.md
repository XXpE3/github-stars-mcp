# Deeper Seeker

## Overview
The **Deeper Seeker** is an open-source research tool similar to perplexity pro , designed to perform tasks like comprehensive market research, competitor analysis, and investment memo preparation. Building on the foundation of the previous version, **Deeper Seeker V2.0.0** introduces significant improvements in research logic, web search capabilities, and report generation. The tool is designed to:
- Conduct iterative research with continuous refinement.
- Generate structured search queries and analyze results.
- Produce well-formatted, actionable reports with inline citations.

## Key Features
1. **Iterative Research Workflow:**
   - Plans research steps based on user queries.
   - Generates precise search queries using the Exa API.
   - Continuously refines research based on findings.
   - Parallel execution of steps and search queries.

2. **Structured Output:**
   - Produces JSON-structured search queries for API calls.
   - Formats search results with highlights, citations, and summaries.

3. **Comprehensive Reporting:**
   - Synthesizes research findings into actionable reports using Google Gemini.

4. **Multi-Model Support:**
   - Utilizes multiple AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Groq, Google Gemini) for reasoning, planning, and report generation.

---

## How It Works
1. **User Query:**
   - The user provides a research query (e.g., "Analyze the global EV market in 2024").

2. **Follow-Up Questions:**
   - The tool generates follow-up questions to refine the research scope and context.

3. **Research Planning:**
   - The AI creates a detailed research plan, breaking the query into logical steps.Each step leads to multi-query search.

4. **Search Execution:**
   - The tool generates specific search queries for each step and uses the Exa API to search the web for relevant information.
   - Parallel execution of search queries to reduce the latency.

5. **Result Processing:**
   - Search results are processed, formatted, and analyzed.

6. **Final Report:**
   - All findings are synthesized into a comprehensive, well-formatted report using Google Gemini.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshJ23/Deeper-Seeker.git
   cd Deeper-Seeker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
     ```
     EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```

---

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Enter your research query when prompted:
   ```
   Enter your query: Analyze the competitive landscape of the cloud computing industry.
   ```

3. View the research process and final report:
   - The tool will display reasoning, plans, search results, and link counts for each iteration.
   - The final report will be saved as `final_report.md`.

## Example Queries
Here are some sample queries to test the tool:
1. **Market Research:**
   - "Provide an overview of the global electric vehicle (EV) market in 2024."
   - "What are the current trends in the plant-based food industry?"

2. **Competitor Analysis:**
   - "Compare Tesla and Rivian in terms of market share and product offerings."
   - "Analyze the competitive landscape of the cloud computing industry."

3. **Investment Memo Prep:**
   - "Prepare a brief investment memo for a fintech startup specializing in blockchain-based payments."
   - "Evaluate the investment potential of the renewable energy sector."
