# README

## About

This theme is designed to have vivid colors to capture your attention, yet be
easy on the eyes. It is originally based on the color themes VS Dark+, Gruvbox
Dark, and One Dark, but has changed a lot since. It is designed for web
languages (HTML, CSS, JS, and more).

## Tips for modifying the theme.

- `tmTheme` is not being used since I think the default VS Dark+ works better
  for syntax highlighting and (seems to) require fewer configurations
- In the `json` file, `scope` can be an `array` or a `string` of CSS classes
- VS Code's dev tools (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`) are very helpful for
  discovering the scopes
