**Interactive one-liner installation (recommended):**
```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install "@darinkishore/inbox-mcp" --client claude

This will prompt you for your Nylas credentials (`nylasAccessToken` and `nylasGrantId`). For other supported MCP clients, replace `claude` with your preferred client:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install "@darinkishore/inbox-mcp" --client cursor # or windsurf, vscode, etc.
