# BiliBite
The most elegant Bilibili client in the west hemisphere.

# Overview
BiliBite is the first (and the only so far) Bilibili client on Apple TV. This project is mainly written in JavaScript using Apple's TVML framework, but a little bit of native Swift code is also used due to the lack of JavaScript APIs provided by Apple.

BiliBite is claimed to be the most elegant Bilibili client in the west hemisphere. This app is mostly content-focused on anime bangumis without annoying distractions. But if you are a fan of other content (like movies, TV shows or kichiku), the "Top Chart" and "Search" tab is built right for you.

# Usage
This app may not be uploaded to the App Store since I don't have a developer account and US$99 a year is clearly too much for me. As a result, a Mac computer with Xcode installed is essential to deploy the app to an Apple TV. You may be required to re-deploy the app every week due to Apple's limitation on testing without a developer certificate.
